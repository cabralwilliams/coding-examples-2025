# Notes From Session

I'll add notes to this section so that everything is contained in one location.

## HTML Pages
These are the basic canvases that contain the building blocks of the webpage.  While you can technically create a webpage with just an HTML document, in most cases, this is not done.  You will almost always have some CSS (for styling) and some JavaScript (for functionality) added in.

## JS Files
These JavaScript file add the main functionality to the page.  This is where the true programming comes into play and is likely where you will spend most of your time learning.
